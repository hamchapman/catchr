Hello #{@user.username},

Your #{@service} account needs to be re-authorized within the next #{@time} to make sure that we don't miss out on collecting information for you.

To do this just login to your account, navigate to your connections and then re-authorized your #{service} account there.

If for some reason it doesn't work then reply to this email and let me know.
