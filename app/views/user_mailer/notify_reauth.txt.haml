Hi #{@user.username}!

Your #{@service} account needs to be re-authorized within the next #{@time} to make sure that we don't miss out on collecting information for you.

To do this just follow this link:

= link_to 'Reauthorize your account', "#{root_url}users/reauth/#{@provider_name}?" + { id: @acc.id }.to_param, method: :post

Should that not work you can try logging in to your account, navigate to your connections and then re-authorize your #{@service} account there.

If for some reason it doesn't work then reply to this email and let me know.
